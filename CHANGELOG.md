review:

  - Review shows all collections that have all memos completed at least once.
- Progress, showing the user's metadata for application-wide collection's executions, such as time spent, the
percentage for each answer, etcetera;
- Collection details and execution, which allows the user to study upon a compiled collection in this repository;
- Settings page with info related to this project.
